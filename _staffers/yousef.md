Hi, my name is Yousef and I am a senior transfer in EECS. I am from the Bay Area/Egypt, and am looking forward to being a Head TA for EE120 this semester! Some of the stuff I like to do in my free time include playing soccer/basketball, tinkering with my car, and playing board games. I'm looking forward to meeting all of you, and please reach out if you would like to talk about anything at all!
