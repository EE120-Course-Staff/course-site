Howdy! I’m a junior from San Francisco majoring in EECS and Business, and this is my first semester on course staff. When I’m not teaching, I can be found reading up on the latest tech policy news, pretending I’m a film major, and listening to an unhealthy amount of indie music. Looking forward to meeting ya!
