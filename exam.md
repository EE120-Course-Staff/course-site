# Exam Logistics

The final exam is on **Thursday, December 15, 11:30am–2:30pm PT**. If you need to take the exam remotely at that time, or if you need to take the alternate exam (3–6pm PT, in-person only), or if you need DSP accommodations, [please fill out this form by **Sunday, December 11**, 11:59 PM PT](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8NqNxRYpDBZaHmuPuV_2nAWedin9QNCX9i9lg4XjnvNSj3Q/viewform).

The final exam covers the following topics: Lectures 1-23, Notes 1-22, Discussions 1-10, Homework 1-9, and Projects 1-5. Topics covered after the strike began will be tested more lightly.

The final exam will be closed-book, closed-notes, closed-Internet, and no calculator. However, you may use two cheat sheets (each two-sided) of your own design (handwritten and typed both allowed).

## In-Person Logistics

- We'll email you an exam location a day or two before the exam.
- Please try to arrive early, so that we can start on time.

## Remote Logistics

- Before the exam:
    - We'll email you a Zoom link a day or two before the exam.
- On the day of the exam:
    - Join the Zoom meeting on the computer you will be using and share your entire screen.
    - Set up a camera showing your workspace (e.g. join Zoom on your phone, or turn on a webcam feed).

    - When you're done, you can just leave the call. The Gradescope answer sheet will close at 2:30 PM PT.
- Technical difficulties:
    - Don't worry if your video feed disconnects briefly during the exam.
    - If you encounter any logistics problems during the exam, email cs188@berkeley.edu.
    - If you need to use the bathroom, leave your phone in camera view, and leave the video feed on while you're away.

## Academic Integrity

- Any form of communication or collaboration is cheating. Providing answers, receiving answers, and even just talking with others about course material during the exam windows are all violations of the Berkeley honor code.
- Please be mindful to not discuss the exam until solutions are released. Keep in mind that we still have alternates and DSP exams after the normal exam ends.
- If you become aware of any academic dishonesty, you can fill out this anonymous Google Form: [Academic Dishonesty Concerns](https://forms.gle/yiRop1qnTqDdsvLt8).
