## Enrollment

**Q1: I'm not a declared CS or Data Science major. Can I enroll in the class?**

Sorry, course staff is not in charge of enrollment. We have to follow [the department's enrollment policies](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/cs/degree-reqs/enrollment-policy), which restricts CS 188 enrollment to declared CS and Data Science majors only. We don't have enrollment codes to hand out or any other way to circumvent this policy; if you have further questions, please reach out to the emails listed in the linked document.


**Q2: I plan to declare CS or Data Science this spring. Can I enroll in the class after I declare?**

If your declaration is processed in time, and the enrollment system lets you enroll in the class this semester, we can let you enroll. However, **we are not offering assignment extensions if you enroll late**. If you plan to enroll in the class this spring, you need to keep up with the class before you enroll; we can give you access to all the assignments while you wait to enroll (see Q4 below).


**Q3: I'm a concurrent enrollment student. When can I enroll in the class?**

The department processes concurrent enrollment applications, not us. They said that they will start processing applications the week of January 16, so please wait until then for updates.


**Q4: I want to audit the class and/or keep up with assignments before I officially enroll. Can I audit the class?**

Sure, we can add you to the course Gradescope and Ed forum. Send an email to cs188@berkeley.edu with 1) your name, 2) your SID, and 3) whether you're auditing or plan to enroll later.

If you're just auditing and don't ever plan on enrolling, please do not submit any assignments that would require staff effort to grade (e.g. problem sets, exams). If you're auditing and we spend extra staff time grading your work, we will drop you from the class.


**Q5: I officially enrolled in the class, but I don't have access to Gradescope/Ed.**

We sync the rosters once a day, so you may need to wait a bit before being automatically added to the class. If you've been officially enrolled for 48 hours and haven't been added, send an email to cs188@berkeley.edu. **Please don't ask us about being added until 48 hours have passed**; we don't have time to manually add each student.


## Exams

**Q6: When are the exams?**

The midterm is on Monday, March 6, 2023, 8–10pm PT.

The final exam is on Friday, May 12, 2023, 11:30am–2:30pm PT.


**Q7: Can I take this class remotely? Do you offer remote exams?**

We don't have any parts of the class that require in-person attendance, so if you take the entire class remotely, we won't know. However, this class is officially listed by the university as in-person, so not all aspects of the class will have remote support (e.g. office hours or project party might be in-person only; there might be extra credit for in-person attendance).

We are offering remote exams **only at the same time as the scheduled exam**. There will be no remote exams starting at any other time. We'll release a form closer to the exams for you to sign up for a remote exam.


**Q8: Do you offer alternate time exams?**

If you are unable to take the exam at the scheduled time, we will be offering only one alternate exam time, **in-person only, immediately after the scheduled exam**. Specifically, the alternate midterm time is Monday, March 6, 2023, 10pm–12am PT. The alternate final exam time is Friday, May 12, 2023, 2:30pm–5:30pm PT (we'll give you a few minutes to walk between exams). There are no other alternate exam times. There are no remote exams at alternate times. We'll release a form closer to the exams for you to sign up for an alternate-time exam.
