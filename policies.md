<!-- ## Enrollment

Course staff does not control enrollment; we have to follow [the department's Fall 2022 enrollment policies](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/enrollment.shtml). We do not have any enrollment codes or any other way to let non-CS majors into the class. If you have any questions about enrollment, please reach out to the emails listed in the enrollment policies page.

Concurrent enrollment applications will be processed in the second week of classes. We will add all pending concurrent enrollment students to the course so you can follow along the first few weeks.

--- -->

## Prerequisites

We reccomend having some previous linear algebra/circuits experience (either in the form of EECS16A/B or other relavant courses). before taking EE120. We also reccomend having some previous programing experience (preferably in Python) to use on the labs.


---

## Communication

The course schedule and all resources (e.g. homework, discussion worksheets) will be posted on the course website: [{{ '/' | absolute_url }}](/).

All course announcements and content/logistics questions will happen on either Ed (the course discussion forum) or BCourses. We will be automatically enrolling everyone in these two platforms.

If you need to contact the course staff privately, please email e120-sp23-admin@lists.berkeley.edu.

---

## Labs

There are 5 labs, submitted on Gradescope. We'll enroll all students in Gradescope automatically.


---

## Homeworks

There will be 8-12 Homeworks spread throughout the semester. 

Homeworks cannot be turned in late unless you have extensions or accommodations. However, we will drop your lowest homework score.

Each homework has two components, described below:

### Written HW

The Homework Part. They will be due the Friday the week after they are due at 11:59pm, with a grace period until Sunday at 11:59pm

### HW Self-Grade

A self-grade that you will complete after each HW.

---

## Accommodations and Extensions

If you have any extentuating circumstances or otherwise, and feel that you would need an extension, please make a post on Ed.

The Disabled Students' Program (DSP) supports disabled students at UC Berkeley. They offer a wide range of services and accommodations. If you are facing barriers in school due to a disability, apply to DSP! Students registered with DSP can expect to receive an onboarding email within a week of sending us your formal letter of accommodation through the AIM portal.

## Lectures

**Lecture Time**: ________.

Lectures will be in-person, with recordings posted after (as soon as they are available, hopefully the evening of lecture) to YouTube. Links to lecture recordings will be posted on Ed.

We will post a thread on Ed at the end of each lecture where you can ask any questions you have.

If at any time you are feeling ill or need to isolate yourself due to close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID, please do NOT come to live lecture or discussion. You can watch the lecture recordings and discussion walkthrough videos instead, and let us know promptly if you would like further support.

## Discussions

**Discussion Times**: ______

Two TAs will teach discussion each week. We will post the worksheet to bCourses and Ed on Friday mornings, along with the TAs that will teach discussion that week. Attend whichever section you would like so long as it is not oversubscribed. Discussions will be in-person, but we will post worksheet walkthrough videos after discussion. The first discussion is on Friday, January 20.

<!-- ## Collaboration and Ethics

Please note that obtaining, sharing, and posting solutions to homework or projects is a violation of academic integrity. This includes uploading project code, official solutions, your own solutions, etc. to any site that is accessible by other people, such as a public GitHub repository.

Homework/Project submissions should acknowledge all collaborators and sources consulted. All code and written responses should be original. We trust you all to submit your own work, but to protect the integrity of the course from anyone who doesn't want to play by the rules, we will actively be checking for code plagiarism (both from current classmates and previous semesters), as well as written homework submissions that look eerily similar.

If you use a code snippet from a website like StackOverflow for a small task (for example, capitalizing a string), this is fine, but please cite your sources in your code with a comment.

Exams are expected to demonstrate your work, and your work alone. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of collaboration on exams. We are not lenient about cheating; in past semesters, CS 188 has caught upwards of 50 students for academic dishonesty and directly reported them to the Center for Student Conduct. An overwhelming majority (>90%) of the students were found guilty, and thus earned an "F" in the class and a mark on their transcript. Please, just don't cheat. It's not cool.

We sympathize with [Kris Pister's policy](http://www-bsac.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pister/etc/Cheating.htm).

## Inclusion

We believe in the crucial importance of creating a learning environment that is welcoming and respectful to students of all backgrounds. The following are specific steps that will help us in achieving this goal:

- If you feel your academic performance has been impacted negatively due to a lack of inclusion, or due to experiences outside of class such as current events or family matters, please reach out to the instructors and staff. Our job is not only to teach but to support you in every way we can.
- If something happens in the course that runs counter to the goal of making every student feel safe, respected, and welcome, please contact the head TA or the instructors; if you don't feel comfortable contacting course staff, you can fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4NYHdUJ8IzYA1SoiTinWBybGWkj0mfmdnHAeygAxkZajelQ/viewform) to anonymously let the department know.
- You may also consult a departmental [Faculty Equity Advisor](https://diversity.berkeley.edu/faculty-equity-advisors), or fill out the [anonymous feedback form](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/about/equity-and-inclusion/feedback/) for the College of Engineering for equity and inclusion related feedback.
- If you have a preferred name or set of pronouns that differ from your legal name, you may designate a preferred name for the classroom by following these [steps](https://registrar.berkeley.edu/academic-records/your-name-records-rosters).
- As a member of the CS 188 community, realize that you have an important duty to help other students feel respected in helping create an inclusive learning environment.

## Support During Remote Learning

From the College of Engineering:

> We understand that your specific situation may present challenges to class participation. Please contact the instructors if you would like to discuss these and co-develop strategies for engaging with the course.
> 
> The Student Technology Equity Program ([STEP](https://technology.berkeley.edu/STEP)) is available to help you access a laptop, Wi-Fi hotspot, and other peripherals.
> 
> You will be alerted as to when synchronous sessions are about to be recorded. If you prefer not to be recorded, you may turn your video and microphone off. Please set your Zoom name to be the name you would like instructors to call you. You may optionally include your personal pronouns. Please set your Zoom picture to an appropriate profile picture of you to foster a sense of community and enhance interactions. If you are not comfortable using an image of yourself, you may use an appropriate picture of an avatar. We encourage participating with your video on to foster a sense of commnuity and enhance interactions. However, we understand that some students are not comfortable with video or may not be able to participate by video. -->
